# OffenSkill Website

[![Deploy Static Website](https://github.com/laluka/osk-shop/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/laluka/osk-shop/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

A modern, responsive website for OffenSkill - showcasing cybersecurity services including pentesting, training programs, and mentoring services. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## 📸 OpenGraph Thumbnails

To have nice previews when sharing links on social media, you can generate screenshots of your pages:

```bash
# One-time setup: install playwright and chromium
npx playwright install chromium

# Generate screenshots (runs a local dev server automatically)
npm run thumbnails
```

Thumbnails use a 720×405 viewport at 2× resolution for readable text in link previews. They are saved in `public/assets/thumbnails/`. Make sure to commit them before pushing to GitHub!
